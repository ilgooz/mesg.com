      <h2>Share and Reuse Services</h2>
      <p>By connecting services to Core rather than your application, they can be re-used and shared, effectively transforming services into sharable commodities.</p>
      <p>Core features event-driven architecture, allowing you to experiment with different services, including cross-chain transactions. This allows maximum flexibility to keep iterating your application until your perfect solution is developed. </p>
      <p>Thatâ€™s just the beginning. Together we're building a decentralized infrastructure so developers can just plug and play and be rewarded for their contributions. </p>
