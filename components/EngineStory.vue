          Today, one of the biggest challenges in the tech industry is the efficient connection between separate systems.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Hundreds of billions of dollars is spent annually by companies trying to connect them. Each year, an increasing number of new devices, products and applications are released, causing this problem to continually get worse.

            Todayâ€™s popular way of making applications is to code a direct connection between two or more systems. This process is costly, inefficient and requires frequent and complex overhauls.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            MESG is a flexible platform which allows for the connection of nearly every system and technology in a normalized way. The MESG Engine normalizes connections between nearly every system and technology.

          First, MESG Modules connect directly to the source of data through APIs, decentralized networks or standalone microservices. Then, MESG Engine provides connectivity between those Modules and other devices and applications.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The Engine allows you to control the flow of data and the level of security between all connected technologies so that you can maintain your own application network.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Modules can be combined together into workflows, and those workflows can be combined into applications. The opportunities and possibilities are limitless.
