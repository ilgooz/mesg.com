          MESG allows for the connection of nearly every system or technology in a normalized way.  This is done by creating a connection directly to the source of data through APIs, standalone microservices or even decentralized networks.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          These connections to systems are called MESG Modules and they can be created by any developer.
