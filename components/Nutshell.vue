        <h2>MESG in a nutshell</h2>
        <p>
          MESG is a <strong>decentralized building platform</strong> for apps and businesses where developers can build solutions from a library of shared, pre-built bridges (called MESG Services) to features on technologies.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          All shared bridges to technologies can be reused and combined to create new applications and solutions. The interaction between all connected bridges is managed by MESGâ€™s software, so now, building powerful applications can be as easy as connecting existing Services together.
