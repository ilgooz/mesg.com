          <h2>Build a MESG Module</h2>
          <p>
            This is done by creating a connection directly from the MESG Engine to the source of data through APIs, or decentralized networks like blockchains. These connections to systems are called MESG Modules and they can be created by any developer.

          Let’s say Frank wrote a Module connecting to SalesForce. He gets paid every time anyone uses his Module. Now, companies can use the Module created by Frank, and simply plug it into their application. Frank is now generating income in his sleep. Like Frank, companies too can get in on the action and create reusable Modules, opening up new streams of revenue.

          <h2>Combine Modules</h2>
          <p>
            Frank’s Module connecting to SalesForce can be reused into simple workflows, and those workflows can be combined into full applications. Upon each integration, profit is delivered back to Frank. <strong>Introducing the new economy of application development</strong>.
