            There is no common channel for blockchains to communicate with business technologies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Business IT infrastructures require inefficient and costly updates to accommodate new features.
          </li>
          <li>
            As new technologies and devices enter the market, interoperability between these devices increasingly becomes an issue.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prototyping products or features, particularly those based in blockchain, requires immense overhead and a large resource commitment, simply to test out a single technology.

          We see opportunity in these issues. To solve them, we are tackling three large challenges within the business and tech industries simultaneously:
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Interoperability -</strong> Free communication between any combination of blockchains, web and IoT
          <strong>Scalability -</strong> A single infrastructure from startup to multi-national corporation
          <strong>Efficiency -</strong> Streamline business functions with truly set-and-forget automation
