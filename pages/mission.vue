          <h2>Build upon collective wisdom</h2>
          <p>The promise of the internet at its inception was to be a common, impartial network providing equal access to connections and ideas for the progress and betterment of humanity. </p>
          <p>Along the way, we strayed from the internet’s original mission and its potential to unite us.</p>
          <p>The global trend towards centralization has created a host of problems. Large corporations to bootstrapping entrepreneurs now find themselves in vulnerable positions with many points of failure. </p>
          <p>MESG introduces an infrastructure designed with best practices in mind. It’s a bridge between today’s web and the internet of tomorrow. </p>

          <h2>Devolving back to First Principles</h2>
          <p>Blockchain technology and the push towards a decentralized internet gives us an incredible opportunity to redesign the organization and economy of the internet, and to devolve it back towards a decentralized network of networks, where there’s no central regulating authority. </p>
          <p>Projects like Bitcoin and Ethereum have done their part in creating awareness and economies around this mission. They are both essential stepping stones, but we’ve seen them struggle with the challenges that have come with the adoption and implementation of blockchain technology. </p>
          <p>Let’s use the best of existing innovations, such as blockchain technology and decentralization, when and where it’s most optimal. Centralization has some great benefits. And moving completely over to blockchain technology is not required, or optimal, for all applications.</p>
          <p>MESG is giving businesses a way to improve what they are already doing by providing them with an easy path to increasing transparency and decentralizing their systems.</p>
          <p>The MESG building platform enables you to create solutions and be rewarded for your contributions. Even passively participating by running your computer helps power the decentralized Network. </p>
          <p>Let’s work together to create technology-agnostic fully-customized solutions designed to be efficient. </p>
          <p>MESG empowers anyone - novices, businesses and developers - to build solutions and take them to market much faster and with less friction than ever before, and to share tools in a supportive economy.</p>
          <p>Anyone can be a contributor, an innovator, a builder. Experience the paradigm shift for yourself.</p>
