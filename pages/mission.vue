          <h2>Call us idealists. Or maybe we’re just drawing upon collective wisdom.</h2>

          <p>We’ve built an incredibly powerful tool for developers to connect all technologies through services in their applications. </p>
          <p>This is the first technology of its kind. </p>
          <p>We have incorporated the latest breakthroughs in development efficiency into an architecture which provides developers with the ultimate building platform so they can focus on innovations rather than operations.</p>
          
          <h2>Let’s Devolve back to First Principles.</h2>
          
          <p>The promise of the internet at its inception was to be a common, impartial network providing equal access to connections and ideas for the progress and betterment of humanity. </p>
          <p>Along the way, we strayed from the internet’s original mission and its potential to unite us.</p>
          <p>The move towards centralization has created a host of problems. We’ve entrusted large corporations and entities with too much power. Now they’ve put themselves in a vulnerable position with many centralized points of failure which could have massive repercussions on society if they were to fail. They’re also profiting from gathering, organizing and monetizing our information whether we like it or not.</p>
          <p>Blockchain technology and the push towards a decentralized internet gives us an incredible opportunity to redesign the organization and economy of the internet, and to devolve it back towards a decentralized network of networks, where there’s no central regulating authority.</p>
          <p>Projects like Bitcoin and Ethereum have done their part in creating awareness and economies around this mission. They are both necessary stepping stones, but we’ve seen them struggle with the challenges that have come with the adoption of blockchain technology. </p>
          <p>Let’s use the best of existing technologies and innovations, such as blockchain technology and decentralization, when and where it makes sense. Because centralization has benefits and moving completely over to blockchain technology is not required or even beneficial for all applications.</p>
          <p>MESG introduces an infrastructure designed with best practices in mind. It’s a bridge between today’s web and the internet of tomorrow. </p>
          <p>Our building platform empowers you to create solutions and be rewarded for your contributions. Even passively participating by running your computer helps power the decentralized Network. </p>
          <p>Let’s work together to create technology-agnostic fully-customized solutions designed to be efficient. We empower anyone - novices and developers - to build solutions and take them to market much faster and with less friction than ever before and to share tools in a supportive economy.</p>
          <p>Anyone can be a contributor, an innovator, a builder. We’re excited to see what you come up with! </p>
