And events are easier to work with. </p><p>Using MESG Modules, you create any applications simply by connecting a third-party event to the execution of a Module. By design, MESG lets you easily have a reactive application that listens for events from any data source, whether it be a web service or a blockchain, allowing for simple and easy-to-maintain modular applications. </p>"
